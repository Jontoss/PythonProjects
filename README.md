# PythonProjects

Python Projects that I completed as part of University assessment in 2018.

CityScapeDrawing utilises turtle to draw set buildings in differing positions and makeups onto a canvas, by reading information supplied randomly by a multidimensional array.

OnlineShoppingApp is a python script which utilises tKinter, regex and sqlite3 libraries to create a mock version of a shopping application. 
It reads from a set of xml files retrieved (2 downloaded files, 2 retrieved on request) from various shopping sites to display the first 10 item's names and prices. The user can add items to their cart
and checkout, which provides a html invoice file with all purchased items, and stores the last purchase in a DB file.
